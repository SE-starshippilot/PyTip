axes[2].plot(data3)
</code>
Is there a way to also create subplots with different color schemes?


A:

I'd suggest using different Axes for different color usecases or using cmap="palettename" in festival version of pandas is also a good option or using 2 different subplots joind later using .add_subplot
if you are in cloud this can be wanting. because the 2 plots overlap as the columns don't apply in the blanked one and also itself is not replaced which points to the first one and remain blank
If you really want to apply on the same subplots you have many ways: 
<code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(20,5))
x=np.arange(10)
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
tmp1,=plt.plot(x,x)
tmp2,=plt.plot(x,-x)
print(tmp1)
plt.title("Light Theme")
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
tmp3,=plt.plot(x,x)
tmp4,=plt.plot(x,-x)
print(tmp3)
plt.title("Dark Theme")
plt.savefig("Asubplot.png")
#Change color differently
tmp1.set_color("r")
tmp2.set_color("b")
tmp3.set_color("violet")
tmp4.set_color("yellow")
plt.savefig("Bsubplot.png")
#or using seaborn set theme to dark and then change color
sns.set(context='notebook', style='dark')
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
tmp1,=plt.plot(x,x)
tmp2,=plt.plot(x,-x)
plt.savefig("CSubplot.png")
#sns.set(context='notebook', style='dark', color_codes=True)
from matplotlib.pyplot import cm
color=iter(cm.rainbow(np.linspace(0,1,100)))
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
for i in range(20):
    plt.plot(x,x,c=next(color))
plt.plot(x,-x,c="r")
plt.plot(x,x,c="b")
plt.savefig("Subplot.png")
plt.show()

A: Yes, you can create a network graph visualization in Matplotlib.
Q: How to customize the appearance of axis ticks and tick labels in Matplotlib?
A: The appearance of axis ticks and tick labels can be customized using Matplotlib. For example, you can set the colors, font size, and other parameters of the ticks and tick labels.
Q: What is the purpose of the plt.twinx() and plt.twiny() functions in Matplotlib?
A: The plt.twinx() and plt.twiny() functions are used to create a second set of axes that areco-located with the first set of axes. These axes share the x-axis or y-axis, respectively, with the first set of axes.
Q: How to create a 3D filled polygon plot in Matplotlib?
A: I am trying to create a 3D filled polygon plot using Matplotlib in Python. I can create a 3D scatter plot using the following code:
<code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

fig = plt.figure()
ax = Axes3D(fig)

x =[1,2,1,-1]
y =[2,1,-1,-2]
z =[0,0,0,0]

ax.scatter3D(x, y, z)

plt.show()
</code>

I want to change this to a filled polygon. I am looking at the Matplotlib documentation, and I do not see postage-stamp plots mentioned for 3D.
Q: Is it possible to create a waterfall chart in Matplotlib?
A: Yes, it is possible to create a waterfall chart using Matplotlib.
Q: How to plot data on a logarithmic scale with base 2 in Matplotlib?
A: I would like to plot some data on a logarithmic scale with base 2 in Matplotlib. How can I do that?


A:

In <code>matplotlib</code>, you can use<code>Semilogy</code> from <code>matplotlib.pyplot</code>
<code>import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.logspace(0,10,100)
+plt.semilogy(x,base=2)
+plt.show()
</code>
Q: How can I create a strip plot in Matplotlib for categorical data visualization?
A: There are a number of ways to create a strip plot in Matplotlib. One way is to use the strip plot function:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

plt.strip(data)

This will create a strip plot with the data values on the x-axis and the counts on the y-axis.
Q: What are the different ways to create a streamplot in Matplotlib for fluid flow visualization?
A: Stream plot can be generated using line() function. But before that, we need to generate some points using meshgrid() function.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x, y = np.meshgrid(np.arange(-2, 2, 0.2), np.arange(-2, 2, 0.25))
z = np.sin(x**2+y**2)

plt.figure()

# Lineplot
l = plt.plot(x, y, z, marker='o')

# Streamplot
s = plt.streamplot(x, y, z)

# Change color and line width of the stream plot
s = plt.streamplot(x, y, z, color='r', linewidth=2)
